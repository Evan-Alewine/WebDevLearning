							Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit.
							It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.
							He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another century of readers--and spirit itself will stink.
							Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not only writing but also thinking.
							Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace.
							He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read, but learnt by heart.
							In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall.
							The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched.
							I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The courage which scareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins--it wanteth to laugh.

							Who has never killed an hour? Not casually or without thought, but carefully: a premeditated murder of minutes. The violence comes from a combination of giving up, not caring, and a resignation that getting past it is all you can hope to accomplish. So you kill the hour. You do not work, you do not read, you do not daydream. If you sleep it is not because you need to sleep. And when at last it is over, there is no evidence: no weapon, no blood, and no body. The only clue might be the shadows beneath your eyes or a terribly thin line near the corner of your mouth indicating something has been suffered, that in the privacy of your life you have lost something and the loss is too empty to share.

							You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin - just in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all.<br><br>

							You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, "There is a price we will not pay." "There is a point beyond which they must not advance." And this - this is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater's "peace through strength." Winston Churchill said, "The destiny of man is not measured by material computations. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we're spirits - not animals." And he said, "There's something going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty."<br><br>

							You and I have a rendezvous with destiny.

							Just A Common Soldier<br>
							(A Soldier Died Today)<br>
							He was getting old and paunchy and his hair was falling fast,<br>
							And he sat around the Legion, telling stories of the past.<br>
							Of a war that he had fought in and the deeds that he had done,<br>
							In his exploits with his buddies; they were heroes, every one.<br>
							And tho' sometimes, to his neighbors, his tales became a joke,<br>
							All his Legion buddies listened, for they knew whereof he spoke.<br>
							But we'll hear his tales no longer for old Bill has passed away,<br>
							And the world's a little poorer, for a soldier died today.<br>
							He will not be mourned by many, just his children and his wife,<br>
							For he lived an ordinary and quite uneventful life.<br>
							Held a job and raised a family, quietly going his own way,<br>
							And the world won't note his passing, though a soldier died today.
